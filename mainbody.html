            <p>My full name is Johanes Lawrence Scott II. S. Leyran, Age 17. Most of the projects that I mentioned here I
                have no longer acess to. I have made them for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>I am still a student and I have more to learn.</p>

                    <h1 class="type-1">Machine Learning</h1>
                    <p class="type-1">Though I have yet to learn all the wonders of machine learning, Making the computer
                        to able to get the patterns on the data and having it able to learn from its mistakes
                        intrigued me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-1">I haved done several machine learning projects where the model will predict with the use of data,
                        The first one is the heart attack prediction. Where based on the data that is given, the model
                        will utilize it to predict whether the patient has high likelyhood of having an heart attack or not.
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-1">I also did a model that will analyze a person's job, life, place, salary, etc. To decide
                        whether it should let the person get a loan. Sometimes a person will get a loan and not pay its debt but with
                        the use of this model a company could use it to determine if their client is worth to give loan to.
                    </p>

                <div class="info" id="info-2">
                    <h1 class="type-2">Reinforcement Learning</h1>
                    <p class="type-2">It is a branch of machine learning, It composes of an environment, agent, and rewarding system.
                        An agent will do some actions within an envirrnment and the rewarding system will tell how good is the agent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-2">This is most commonly used in video games, the game itself is the envirornment and the agent is the player.
                        I have done a project where I made a game in python and imbued reinforcement learning to it. Another project I did is to
                        make a agent play through an existing games such as a platformer games. The agent with enough time will able to master the
                        game.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="type-3">Data Scraper and Automation</h1>
                    <p class="type-3">Data is a very important factor in machine learning and one of the ways of getting datas is through
                        data scraping. Though not all people are supporting this way of collecting data. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-3">One of my projects is to collect all the data in a e-sport tournament matches that collects all of the team's
                        informations such as winrate, every match-up they have, all of theit players, etc. And data scraping is also an auotmation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-3">Automation is a way of auotoomatically doing repeated task such as checking your email or doing excels and many
                        more. I mainly use python for this kind of job. For python is very easy to use and more versatile than other programming langauges.
                    </p>
                    <p class="type-3">One of the projects that I made is a chatbot for my friends, it also incorporates machine learning NLP
                        (Natural Language Processing) to be specicif. Where my friends could ask for something and the chatbot will understand what
                        are they saying without needing to hardcode every possible sentences.
